# <Horiseon-Code-Refactor>

## Description

-My motivation in this project was to refactor the code given and improve functionality as well as improve the overall look and organization of the code. 
-This solves the problem of unnecessary and repetitive class calls in the css file. 
-In this project I learned how to structure a css file to match the order of how it is structured in the html file. I also learned many different ways you can group different classes without disrupting the overall look of the webpage.
